        <p>“Once upon a time, two brothers lived in Cusco: Salkantay and Ausangate.
         When there was a drought in Cuzco, they ventured to other lands to save their
         people. Salkantay went north. There the jungle, the forbidden love of a girl
         named Veronica and many problems were waiting for him. And the other brother,
         Ausangate, went south. There he discovered a fertile valley and was able to send 
         potatoes, maize, llama and alpaca meat to Cuzco and thus saved the inhabitants of 
         the city.” </p>
        <p>This is the legend about the mountain brothers told by the Quechua Indians.</p>

            <h2 align="center"><font color=ForestGreen><p>Highest mountain in Peru</p></font></h2>
        <p>Ausangate is the highest peak of the second longest and most glaciers mountain 
            chain in Peru: the Cordillera Vilcanota, 120 km long. The Cordillera Vilcanota is 
            located approximately 100 km southeast of Cusco. It is here, in these glaciers, 
            that the great Vilcanota River originates, which then flows into the Amazon and 
            carries water to the Atlantic Ocean.
    </p>
    <p>  At 6,384 meters above sea level, Ausangate is the fifth highest mountain in Peru (and 
        one of the highest in Latin America), behind Huascaran, Yerupaja, Coropuna and Huandoy.</p>
        <p>In the middle of the 20th century, several expeditions tried to conquer the peak of 
        Ausangate.The first in 1950 was the Italian Piero Ghiglione. After an unsuccessful first
         attempt, he assembled a multinational expedition and returned in 1952. But this time too,
         the expedition failed to climb the main peak of Ausangate. Finally, in 1953, an Austro-German 
         expedition was able to reach the top of Ausangate. And only 30 years later the first Peruvian 
         expedition climbed that mountain for the first time!</p>

    <h2 align="center"><font color=ForestGreen><p>Holiday Qoyur Rit'i</p></font></h2>
    <p>Ausangate is one of the main Apu: the patron gods of Cuzco. During the Inca Empire, the Indians 
    worshiped this God and held a holiday in his honor. With the arrival of the Spanish colonialists, 
    the tradition of celebrating remained, but was mixed with the Christian holiday of the Holy Trinity.
    </p>
    <p> Qoyur Rit'i is celebrated in late May - early June and is celebrated for several days. In the 
        Quechu language, Qoyllur Rit'i means “brilliant, shining white snow.” The festival takes place
        in the Temple at the foot of the Ausangate glacier. During this period, pilgrims come here not 
        only from surrounding villages, but also from all over the country and even from neighboring states.
        A comic fair is taking place near the Temple. People dressed in national costumes dance traditional
        dances. But the main action of Koyyur Riti does not take place here.</p>
    <p>A group of Indians in traditional costumes for their community goes to the top of Ausangate. 
        Foreigners are strictly prohibited from taking part in this - it is believed that this will offend 
        Apu Ausangate. For several days, pilgrims go to the top: they make their way along dangerous paths, 
        freeze at rest stops, suffocate in thin air, and overcome many difficulties along the way. Quite often
        accidents occur - it happens that not everyone is destined to return back (in this case they say that 
        Apu Ausangate received his victim). All this is done for the main purpose of the pilgrimage: to bring
        a piece of snow from the glacier to the Temple. People believe that this ice brings good luck and 
        heals illnesses, and if you irrigate the earth with melted ice, it will be generously fertile.
