    <h2 align="center" style="color: blue; font-size:20px;">Rainbow Mountains in Peru</h2>   
    <p>The Rainbow Mountains are a natural wonder,
     a new wonder of the world that National Geographic
     included in its “100 Places to Visit in Your Lifetime.”
     The Rainbow Mountains in Peru are not as famous as those 
     in China and are still a little known tourist destination 
     for those looking for a weekend getaway.

    <p>Rainbow Mountain in Peru is located in the Vinicunca Valley 
    in the Andes - this is a whole multi-colored valley in which 
    there are all the colors of the rainbow, in the language of the
    Quechua Indians descendants of the Incas, Vinicunca means “rainbow
     mountain”, according to one version, and another version of the name
     suggests that Vinikunka means “vini” - stone, “kunka” - neck,
     bottleneck.

    <p>The existence of the rainbow mountain became known not long ago;
        it was revealed to the world because, due to global warming, the
        snow melted on the mountain and all the beauty of this place was 
        revealed.
    </p>
    <p>The first tourists came to see the Rainbow Mountain Vinicunca in 
        2016; the tourist route was laid out in such a way that tourists
        would not go to the mountain itself; this is prohibited, so as not
        to disturb the natural pattern.

    <h2 align="center"><font  color="blue"><p>Where are the Rainbow Mountains in Peru?</p></font></h2>
        <p>The Rainbow Mountains are located 100 kilometers from Cusco in the province of 
        Quispicanchis at an altitude of 5200 meters above sea level among snowy peaks and 
        turquoise lagoons. From there there is a magnificent view of the
        <a href="Ausangate Glacier.html" target="_blank">Ausangate glacier</a>  
        - sacred mountain of the Incas, where pilgrims gather every year to celebrate 
        the day of Qoyllur Rit'i.
    </p>
    <p>The journey to the Vincunca Valley to the Rainbow Mountain begins in 
        the ancient Incan city of Cusco. Experienced tourists are advised to 
        stay here for a couple of days for acclimatization, because the path 
        to the Rainbow Mountain is long, and you should prepare for it. You'll 
        have to get up early, at 3 a.m., but it's worth it.
        On the tourist's path there will be small villages of real Indians in
        traditional clothes, herds of alpacas grazing peacefully in the valleys.
        The mountain that tourists and locals seek is
         hidden in the middle of the glacial mountains in the Vilcanota region 
         of southern Peru.
